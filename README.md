# PROJECT NAME:PODA AI üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name:ORBIT

### Team Members
- Team Lead: Adwitha Nair - TKM College of Engineering
- Member 2: Neeta A Suresh - TKM College of Engineering


### Project Description
This project presents an interactive chatbot interface inspired by traditional Kerala culture, featuring a humorous ‚ÄúMalayali uncle‚Äù persona. It aims to engage users through witty Malayalam dialogues , creating an entertaining and regionally grounded digital experience.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Most chatbot interfaces today lack cultural personality and emotional relatability. Our project solves this by designing a regionally inspired Malayalam-style AI bot that brings humor, familiarity, and local flavor to digital conversations‚Äîturning a typically bland user experience into something entertaining and engaging

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We developed a culturally themed AI chatbot interface that mimics the tone, expressions, and personality of a typical humorous Malayalam-speaking ‚Äúuncle‚Äù character. By combining regional language flair, animated visuals, and a responsive design, the solution offers users a fun, emotionally engaging, and relatable interaction experience‚Äîmaking digital communication more lively and locally resonant.

This project is a chat interface where a virtual character named ‚ÄúCheta‚Äù, a witty Kollam uncle, responds to user messages in Manglish using sarcasm, attitude, and humor.\
Key Features:
Keyword-based local response (offline mode).

Fallback to Groq LLM API for generating responses when no keyword match.

Fully styled frontend with avatars (Jagathy for bot, Sreenivasan for user).

CORS-enabled backend for easy API consumption.

Flow:
User types a message in the React UI.

React sends a POST request to /chat in FastAPI.

FastAPI checks for keyword matches ‚Üí else sends to Groq.

Response is returned and displayed with avatar.
